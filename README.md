# Mini Mercari Web App | Team 14 | Best Product Award 👑

## Introduction

Developed in the concluding Hackathon week of Mercari's BUILD training programme, our team set out to build a mini Mercari app that represented our vision of the Mercari marketplace. Inspired by our own experiences of using the app, we raced against the clock to develop an app that doubled down on having an intuitive user experience, and an interactive user interface.

Our signature feature was the “comment reply” function, where comments on listings can be nested to improve readability. This embodied our vision of augmenting user interactions within the app - to be seamless and intuitive! 

## Features

### Frontend

- Log in/ Sign up page toggle
- Search listings by keyword

### Backend
